# Movie Trailer Website

---
## Overview
This is a project for the Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.

Using python, server-side code is written to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. This data is served as a web page allowing visitors to review the movies and watch the trailers.

#### Usage

1. Clone the project repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArjaanBuijk/FullstackND-Movie-Trailer-Website
```

2. Run with python3
```bash
python entertainment_center.py
```

- The Movie Trailer Website will be generated and written to disk, named fresh_tomatoes.html.
- The website will be opened with the default webbrowser.
- You can view a movie trailer by clicking on the images.
